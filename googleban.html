                On May 12th, we received an e-mail from Google informing us that our TrackMeNot browser extension, which
                protects users from tracking by search engines, was at risk of being removed from the Chrome Web Store.
                The alleged reason: it violated several of the Chrome Web Store’s Program Policies, such as providing an
                inaccurate description of its functionality or requesting permissions that it did not use. The e-mail
                also warned us that we had two weeks to make the necessary changes to avoid removal of TrackMeNot (TMN)
                from the store. Yet, in spite of the 14-day grace period, Google blocked TMN from the Chrome Store
                <em>the
                  very next day.</em>
                <br><br>
                Blocking TMN from the Chrome Store had two immediate consequences. First, Google notified all current
                users of the software that the extension “contained malware”. Many long-time users (TrackMeNot has been
                listed in the Chrome Store since 2011, as well as the Mozilla store and other app platforms since 2006)
                contacted us to ask how and why they had received this notification, while others started a <a
                  href="https://www.reddit.com/r/brave_browser/comments/uobexc/track_me_not_extension_flagged_as_malware/"
                  target="_blank" class="link">thread on
                  Reddit</a> to discuss why the extension had been disabled, and how it could be restored.
                <br><br>

                Secondly, Google removed TrackMeNot from the Chrome Store, so that new users would not be able to
                install or even to view it.

                  </figure>
                </div>

                <p>Google did not stop there, however. A week later, on May 19<sup>th</sup>, they also blocked our
                  developer account, effectively preventing us from updating or fixing the alleged violations they had
                  cited. With our account blocked, we were not only unable to update TrackMeNot’s code, but we were
                  unable to reach out to our users who had been misled to believe that TMN contained
                  malware.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </p>


                <p>Confused and frustrated by Google's decisions, we reached out to Google the very same day, asking for
                  an explanation and requesting reactivation of our developer account, if only to enable us to fix the
                  so-called "issues” that had been identified. Google’s response came the next day (May
                  20<sup>th</sup>):&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </p>


                <p><em>"Your developer account was suspended from the Chrome Web Store for publishing items that were
                    engaged in malicious activities harmful to users. Given the nature of this violation your account
                    will not be reinstated. We can’t disclose details about the malicious activity due to security
                    reasons”
                  </em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </p>


                <p>We replied again, asking to know, if not the “details”, at least the general nature of the malicious
                  activity with which we were being accused.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </p>


                <p>It was only on June 14th, more than a month after the original suspension of TrackMeNot, and after
                  ignoring multiple requests for explanations, and for reinstatement of our developer account, that
                  Google finally replied, acknowledging their mistake:&nbsp;

                    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our AdNauseam extension was banned previously,</a> this
                  response, while frustrating, was not unexpected. When Google decides that they no longer want software
                  to be available to users, they will
                  <em>find a reason
                  </em> to ban it. &nbsp;
                </p>


                <p>Our experiences with TrackMeNot and AdNauseam, both not-for-profit, free, open-source privacy
                  extensions, with many thousands of users, raises potentially troubling questions regarding Google’s
                  self-appointed role as sole arbiter and gatekeeper for the Chrome Store, and the diminishing options
                  it presents for developers and users alike.&nbsp;
                </p>


                <p>This post is our attempt to be, at very least, transparent about Google’s decision to ban TrackMeNot
                  (and, previously,&nbsp; AdNauseam) and to arbitrarily suspend our developer account, so that users and
                  developers have additional information with which to make decisions about engaging with Google
                  services.&nbsp;&nbsp;
